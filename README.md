# Web-Development
This is one of my earlier web development projects.  
I created it while learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  
I don’t fully remember all the details right now, but it includes my practice files and design experiments.

## Notes
Uploaded for backup and future reference.  
I’ll add more details once I explore the code again.
